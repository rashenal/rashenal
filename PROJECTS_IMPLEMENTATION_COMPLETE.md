## 📋 **Next Steps - URGENT ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### **1. Database Setup (CRITICAL - Do This First)**

```bash
# 1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
# 2. Go to SQL Editor
# 3. Copy and paste the content from: C:\Users\rharv\Documents\rashenal\projects-schema.sql
# 4. Run the script to create all tables and relationships
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The schema file is already created and ready to run. This will:
- Create the `projects` table
- Add `project_id` column to existing `tasks` table  
- Create supporting tables for milestones and scheduling preferences
- Set up all security policies
- Create performance indexes

### **2. Test the Implementation**

1. **🔄 Restart your development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **🧪 Test the flow**:
   - Navigate to `/projects` 
   - Create a new project using one of the revenue templates
   - Verify the project appears in the list
   - Check that tasks are created automatically from templates

3. **🔗 Test Task-Project Integration**:
   - Go to `/tasks` (existing task board)
   - Verify tasks can be associated with projects
   - Check that project tasks show up in both places

### **3. Calendar Integration (Next Priority)**

The calendar system already exists (`CalendarView.tsx`) with auto-scheduling. To complete the calendar integration:

1. **Google Calendar API Setup**:
   - Enable Google Calendar API in Google Cloud Console
   - Add OAuth credentials to your Supabase project
   - Implement calendar sync functionality

2. **Outlook Calendar Enhancement**:
   - Extend existing Outlook integration to include calendar
   - Currently only email is integrated

### **4. Habits Functionality (Lower Priority)**

The habits system has a placeholder. To make it functional:
- Implement habit creation and tracking
- Connect to the existing dashboard displays
- Add habit completion logging
