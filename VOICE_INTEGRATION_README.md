## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**Voice not working in browser:**
- Check microphone permissions
- Try Chrome/Edge for best support
- Ensure HTTPS connection

**WhatsApp messages not responding:**
- Verify webhook URL is accessible
- Check environment variables
- Test with Postman first

**Voice synthesis failing:**
- Check browser compatibility
- Verify text length limits
- Test with simple phrases first

### **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Test webhook locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/whatsapp-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "message"}'

# Check edge function logs
supabase functions logs whatsapp-webhook

# Test voice synthesis
supabase functions invoke voice-processing \
  --data '{"action": "synthesize", "text": "Hello world"}'
```
