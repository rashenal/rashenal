## 🚀 **Plugin Development Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Structured Prompt Creation**
- Define plugin scope and requirements
- Create comprehensive MD prompt document
- Include accessibility and testing specifications
- Add to development queue

### **Phase 2: Standalone Plugin Development**
- **Prerequisites**: Implement Plugin System Core if not already done (see `/docs/specs/plugin-system-implementation.MD`)
- Build as isolated plugin in `/src/plugins/` directory following established patterns
- Use Plugin Registry and Sandbox architecture
- Implement core functionality with proper permission management
- Focus on accessibility and user experience
- Conduct thorough testing with existing plugin test framework

### **Phase 3: Integration Testing**
- Test plugin integration via Plugin Registry system
- Validate data flow through PluginAPI and secure storage
- Test dashboard widget integration and UI components
- Verify sandbox isolation and permission enforcement
- Assess performance and maintenance overhead
- Test voice command registration (if applicable)
- Gather user feedback and metrics

### **Phase 4: Decision Point**
**Plugin vs Core Feature Evaluation:**
- User engagement metrics
- Feature request frequency  
- Strategic alignment with Rashenal vision
- Technical maintenance overhead
- Long-term roadmap fit

### **Phase 5: Implementation**
- **Keep as Plugin:** Publish to plugin marketplace/directory
- **Integrate as Core:** Merge into main codebase with full integration
- **Archive:** Document lessons learned, archive for future reference

## 📊 **Plugin Evaluation Criteria**

### **User Experience Metrics**
- **Adoption Rate**: % of users who try the plugin
- **Retention Rate**: % of users who continue using after 30 days
- **Engagement Depth**: Average sessions per user per week
- **Feature Integration**: % of plugin-generated data that flows to core features

### **Technical Quality Metrics**
- **Performance Impact**: Load time and memory usage
- **Bug Reports**: Number and severity of issues
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA conformance
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability and test coverage

### **Strategic Alignment**
- **Core Vision Fit**: Does this enhance personal transformation?
- **User Request Frequency**: How often do users ask for this feature?
- **Competitive Advantage**: Does this differentiate Rashenal?
- **Resource Requirements**: Development and maintenance effort

## 💡 **Best Practices for Plugin Prompts**

### **Structure Requirements**
- **Clear Overview**: Plugin purpose and scope
- **Technical Architecture**: Component structure and database schema
- **AI Integration Points**: Specific Claude API usage
- **Accessibility Specifications**: WCAG compliance requirements
- **Testing Checklist**: Comprehensive validation criteria
- **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable evaluation criteria

### **Quality Standards**
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on real user problems
- **Accessibility First**: Design for all cognitive and physical abilities
- **AI Integration**: Leverage Claude intelligently, not as decoration
- **Data Integration**: Clean handoff to core Rashenal features
- **Performance Conscious**: Minimal impact on core platform

### **Decision Framework**
Every plugin prompt should answer:
1. **Why**: What user problem does this solve?
2. **How**: What's the technical implementation approach?
3. **Who**: Which users will benefit most from this?
4. **When**: What's the development timeline and dependencies?
5. **Where**: How does this fit in the broader Rashenal ecosystem?
